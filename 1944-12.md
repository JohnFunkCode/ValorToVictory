opposition but apparently none of them attacked the 34BG.)

B-17G
**43-38406 L/W** Battle damaged at Hannover and force landed at Melsbroek
Airfield, Belgium. With 7BS. Pilot: Kimmerle. No Missing Air Crew Report. Badly
damaged by strafing on the ground at Brussels 1-1-45. Salvaged 2-1-45.

 

**December
16, 1944**

B-17G
**44-8598 E/A** crash-landed and salvaged. With 7BS. Pilot: unknown.

 

**December
24, 1944**

**Mission
#102 Frankfurt**

Command
Pilot: CRABTREE. 59 planes dispatched. 57 planes dropped 110 tons on the
primary target. 2 planes failed to bomb. 59 Credit Sorties. Four or five planes
were damaged in runway collision upon return from the mission. This was due to
the fact that a number of planes from another group landed at Mendlesham
because their field was socked in. This left the 34th BG planes circling and
waiting to land until very nearly out of fuel, necessitating very close
landings, one behind the other, eventually resulting in the collisions.
(Cleveland Romero #17. 5 crack-ups on end of runway. 377 group diverted
here.)
