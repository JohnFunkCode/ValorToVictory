NOTE:
No tail gunner is listed on the loading list. Walter Sturdivans book, The
Red Tailed Devils From Mendlesham, appears to indicate that Henry Lambert,
a bombardier, was on this plane and taken Prisoner of War, but he does not
appear on the Missing Air Crew Report nor on the crew loading list.

killed on this date. 44-40267 did abort this mission when unable to feather #1
prop, but the mission report states that the 52 100lb bombs were returned to
base. No battle damaged was reported on this plane but it did ground loop upon
landing, severely damaging the plane. Paulnock and crew were not injured as
they fly again the very next mission, in a different plane of course.
