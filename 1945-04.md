B-17G
**44-8283 B/G *Dinah-Mite***Missing in Action Nuremburg flak.
At bombs away, one bomb hug up on one end of the shackle. The plane left
formation and began trailing behind, eventually losing sight of formation due
to low visibility. Crossing the coast 5-7 miles East of Dunkirk, flak and
machine gun fire hit the plane, seriously wounding Harris (B). A fire broke out
behind #2 engine and the left alerion was shot out. Share (R) was also wounded.
Ditched in the English Channel. At ditching Harris (B) was either dead or near
dead. The Engineer tried but could not free Harris (B) from the debris in the
Radio room. Huntley (CP) apparently never managed to get out. Deines (WG) got
out but was holding on the tail section and would not release, saying he could
not swim, even though he was wearing a MaeWest. He went down with the tail,
still holding on. With 18BS. Pilot: Mehling. No Missing Air Crew Report. 3
Killed in Action, 6 rescued from the Channel and returned to duty one of whom
was WIA.
