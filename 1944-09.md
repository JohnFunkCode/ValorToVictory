**34th
Bomb Group Combat Mission Diary: SEPTEMBER 1944 Missions #64-#70**

compiled
by Gary L. Ferrell

 

Missions
as a B-17 Group in September 1944

 

The
4BS was reorganized as the nucleus for a Pathfinder squadron to furnish
Pathfinder lead crews to the entire 93 Wing, which included the 34BG, 485BG,
490BG, and 493BG. 4BS planes and personnel are therefore rather hard to follow
because they could have flown with any of these groups on any given mission.

B-17G
**43-38294 E/O *The Wrangler***With 7BS. Missing in Action
Kassel mid-air collision. The collision occurred as the planes uncovered
for the bomb run and was thought to be caused by prop wash which caused
this plane, flying in position 3-2, to drop down onto 43-38399, which was
in position 4-1. This plane sustained damage to the wing as its #3 engine
sheared the tail assembly from the other plane. It dropped of on its right wing
going straight down, exploding about 5,000 feet below the formation. As
many as five chutes were seen and 5 crewmembers did survive to be taken
Prisoners of War. Crashed Buren, Germany. Pilot: Whited. Missing Air Crew
Report \# 10199\. 4 Killed in Action, 5 Prisoner of War.
