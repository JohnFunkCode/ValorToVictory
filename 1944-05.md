Mission
#4
Metz

Command
Pilot: WACKWITZ. 36 aircraft were dispatched with 88.7 tons of bombs. 2
aircraft aborted the mission. Only 11 aircraft dropped 26 tons of bombs on an
engine factory at Woippy, a secondary target. Score: fair to good. The primary
target was not bombed due to the dust and smoke from previous bombing by the 92nd
Bomb Wing. The group was enough off course that only a few planes were in a
position to make the bomb run on the secondary target. A few JU-88s and ME-109s
were sighted below and at some distance from the target but there were no
actual enemy fighter encounters.
