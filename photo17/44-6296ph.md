![](44-6296.jpg)  

This plane was photographed at Station A-74 in France. It had landed there March 8, 1945 with two engines out, #1 and #4. Since the photo shows the #1 prop spinning, it probably was taken after the engines were changed and the plane was ready to return to Mendlesham. Station A-74 was Cambrai-Niergnies in France, base for the 394th BG B-26 Mauraders from October 10th 1944 to May 7th 1945\.
