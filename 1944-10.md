was trailing the formation by about 20 miles with one or two engines out and
airspeed at 125 KPH, when the pilot contacted the Group leader to ask for
fighter support and permission to land at a friendly field on the continent.
Permission was granted and fighters dispatched. Different crews monitoring the
VHF heard the pilot contact the fighters and heard the fighters reply that they
would follow him to a friendly field. The pilot was heard on VHF to state he
was heading for Eindhoven, Holland. Unknown if he reached Eindhoven. Later
learned that he forced-landed at Zutphen, Holland. With 7BS. Pilot: Heiby.

**43-38353 E/A *Lili Marlene***With 7BS Missing in Action
Cologne flak. At 0915 hours there was a small fire in #1 engine. Some crews
reported seeing trailing vapor which would indicate the wing tanks were on fire.
After 3-5 minutes the plane peeled out of formation and into a shallow dive in
an apparent attempt to put out the fire. Following this maneuver black smoke
issued from the engine (#1). When last seen, it was trailing smoke, but seemed
under control and holding altitude at 17,000 feet. At 1012 hours, near Liege, a
B-17 was observed flying at 12,000 feet with #1 engine on fire and escorted by
5 P-51 fighters. This could possibly be the same aircraft. Crashed Ahrweiler,
Germany. Pilot: Capt. McAllister. Missing Air Crew Report \# 9468\. 1 Killed in
Action, 9 Prisoner of War including George H. Carroll, wounded in parachute.
See 34th Bombardment Group (H) 1941-1945 pp. 43-44 where
George Ritchie tells in a story titled The Not So Great Escape about his
experience as a Prisoner of War following this mission and his eventual escape.

Pathfinder bombing. Results unobserved. (Cleveland Romero #6. Second time Chaff

stream.) See 34th Bombardment Group (H) 1941-1945, p.44 for
the story Oct. 25, 1944 Mission told by Milton Braveman, which tells of two
crews piloted by Bowen and Jim Sheridan that carried chaff on this mission.
Bowens plane was damaged, losing two engines and was escorted back to England
by Sheridan, who received a DFC for this mission. The next day, Milton Braveman
and another Navigator, Sid Doppelt, are assigned to the 482BG for a month of
Mickey training.
