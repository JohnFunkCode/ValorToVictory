"We experienced our most sobering feelings when we saw
two planes in the squadron just ahead of us go down together. Durette and
Whited were the pilots of the planes. It appeared that one of them, in the high
element, stalled and fell onto the other in the lower element." John

"On our next mission, our brakes were shot out. We

Friedel Leaflets only.

"On our 31st mission, (the 34th's 100th), we carried
leaflets instead of bombs. On the bomb run we discovered that our bomb bay
doors wouldn't open electrically. We cranked the doors open. It took a long
time because the leaflet containers interfered with the turning of the crank. When
we finally had the doors open, we were miles beyond the target, over Darmstadt,
Germany, but we dropped the leaflets anyway, wondering where they would
land." John Friedel

Mission #104 December 28, 1944 43-38382 L/Q 391BS Friedel ***Queenie***

"Our most anxious moments were during our 35th and last
mission. We were flying the left wing of the low element lead. The plane flying
right wing of the low section lead element wandered out of position several
times, each time moving over us. We found ourselves looking up into a bomb bay
that was about to drop bombs and wondering if we were going to be able to avoid
them." John Friedel
