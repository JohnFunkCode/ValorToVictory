Anderson crew

In September, Bowen took over most of what had been the
Anderson crew and Anderson then continued with a largely new crew. Did Bowen
and Anderson switch crews? Either the Bowen or Anderson crew had the name ***Silver
Fox*** associated with them. Neither crew flew more than two or three B-24
missions, so ***Silver Fox*** was most likely a B-17.
