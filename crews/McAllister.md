Flew Lead of Group A (7th).

Carried 52 100 lb bombs. Dropped on Primary at 2055 hours
from 23,000 feet.

Reported Major battle damage.

From Tavastis after mission report: The lead ship
(McAlister) was hit by flak in the Bombay just as bombs were away. Due to the
great amount of gasoline spraying in the Bombay, all electrical units, radios, generators,
inverters and heated suits were turned off. As a result, no strike report was
relayed by lead ship of lead group. An accurate survey of damage was extremely
difficult so lead ship left formation while returning to England. After all
gasoline had drained from the #3 fuel cells, #3 engine was lost as cross-feed
hose was damaged. #3 was feathered for the return flight to base, but
unfeathered shortly before landing to provide hydraulic pressure for gear,
flaps and brakes, as it seemed unadvisable to operate the auxiliary hydraulic
pump with great amounts of liquid gasoline and fumes present in bombay. 

Landed at 2234 hours.

No Crew Loading List available.

Mission #79 October 17, 1944 B-17G **43-38353 E/A *Lili
Marlene***With 7BS Missing in Action Cologne flak. At 0915 hours
there was a small fire in #1 engine. Some crews reported seeing trailing vapor
which would indicate the wing tanks were on fire. After 3-5 minutes the plane
peeled out of formation and into a shallow dive in an apparent attempt to put
out the fire. Following this maneuver black smoke issued from the engine (#1).
When last seen, it was trailing smoke, but seemed under control and holding
altitude at 17,000 feet. At 1012 hours, near Liege, a B-17 was observed flying
at 12,000 feet with #1 engine on fire and escorted by 5 P-51 fighters. This
could possibly be the same aircraft. Crashed Ahrweiler, Germany. Pilot: Capt.
McAllister. Missing Air Crew Report \# 9468\. 1 Killed in Action, 9 Prisoner of
War including George H. Carroll, wounded in parachute. See 34th
Bombardment Group (H) 1941-1945 pp. 43-44 were George Ritchie tells in a
story titled The Not So Great Escape about his experience as a Prisoner of War
following this mission and his eventual escape.
