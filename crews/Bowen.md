Bowen crew

It appears that Bowen took over in September most of what
had been the Anderson crew. Did Bowen
and Anderson switch crews? Either the Bowen or Anderson crew had the name ***Silver
Fox*** associated with them. Neither crew flew more than two or three B-24
missions, so ***Silver Fox*** was most likely a B-17.

The Bowen crew is pictured with the B-17, ***Thelma Jane***.
