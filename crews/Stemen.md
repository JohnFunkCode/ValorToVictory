Stemen crew

Notes from 2001 Reunion conversation with Carl Stemen: The crew's
plane was Mizpah, with Ulm as Crew Chief. Because of the plane's name, the
Chaplain chose this plane to stow away on a couple of missions, figuring it was
safe. On one mission to Bremen, this crew took out three different planes and
aborted three times on the same mission, surely some kind of record. Steman was
WIA in the shoulder on one mission.
