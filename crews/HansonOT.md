KEIRN ROY C is buried at the Netherlands American Cemetery,

The Bits \& Pieces Project shows Joe Burton as KIA and
Lawrence Layton as POW but the records of the 34th BG indicate that
Layton was KIA and that Burton was POW.

A record dated 17 May 1945 changes the status of Joe N.
Brown from MIA to POW as of 30 Nov 1944\. Another record dated 26 May 1945
changes the status of Hanson, Keirn, Simpson and Layton from MIA to KIA as of 30
Nov 1944, based on a letter from 1st United States Army dated 28 April 1945,
"Report of Burial."
