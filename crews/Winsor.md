Mission #54 August 7, 1944 41-28851 E/M Winsor ***The
Near Sighted Robin*** **Remilly**

Flew as an airborne spare but apparently did fly the mission,
filling in position 2-2 in the Low Squadron.

Carried 20 500 lb bombs. All bombs were brought back due to
8/10 cloud coverage of the target area.

The plane did receive slight flak damage.

At 1030 hours, encounter flak from Liege in 3 gun bursts. 3
ships were hit. One feathered #4 engine (not on fire), and dropped his bombs at
1038 hours. Another B-24 with #2 engine feathered and on fire, pulled out of
formation, lost altitude and headed out on course 360 degrees. The lead ship
was seen to pull out of formation in a steep glide (no fires seen), pulled out
and that was the last we saw of this ship. (Note: The lead ship, 44-40323,
piloted by Erwin was MIA on this mission. The other damaged ships made it back
to base.)
