Ames crew

Ames took his transition training at Maxwell AFB, Alabama.
He picked up his crew at Salt Lake City, Utah. Crew Training was at Biggs
Field, Texas. Flew to England by way of the North Atlantic route on June 2,
1944, arriving at Valley Wales. Flew three missions with the 487th BG at
Lavenham prior to transferring to the 4th Squadron, 34th Bomb Group. The name ***Incognito*** has been
associated with his aircraft. This was most likely his B-17, 43-38367, which
later became ***Gotta Haver***.
