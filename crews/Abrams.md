NOTE from a letter from Robert Steiner dated March 30, 2000:
"At first Jerry sent in jets, which we'd not seen before. It was amazing to
see them pull away from our P-51 escort as though the Mustangs were a WWI
aircraft. Then came the ME 190s and FW 190s. I fired my navigator's cheek guns
at a couple of them and could see the face of one pilot as he flew through the
formation. However, the navigator's 50 caliber guns claimed few enemy aircraft.
They had a very limited cone in which they could be fired. I did see Freddie
Reo, who was our left waist gunner, fire at a German fighter and the plane was
obviously hit, began to smoke and plunged downward. After the mission I told
the briefing officer that I thought Freddie had shot the plane down, but he
was officially credited only with damaging the fighter."
