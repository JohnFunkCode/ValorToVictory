Mission #102 December 24, 1944 44-6465 E/O 391BS Baker ***Fancy
Nancy***

This was the first mission flown after the start of the Battle
of the Bulge. It was a maximum effort with the 34th Bomb Group
putting up its greatest number of planes for any mission of the war, even
including two planes designated as war weary. It is unclear which position
Baker was to fly in the 34th BG formation but he ended up flying
with the formation of the 92nd Bomb Group of the 1st
Division of the 8th AF (Triangle B). I have a copy of a report from
the 92nd BG on the strange silver B-17G that joined their
formation that day. According to that report, Baker and ***Fancy Nancy***
took up the number 4 position, low element, high squadron in the 92nd
BG formation. It did drop its 38 100 lb bombs with that group at 1442 hours
from 22,400 feet. The planes radio went out on the mission and was inspected
and repaired upon return to base.
