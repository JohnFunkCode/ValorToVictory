Mission #52 August 5, 1944 41-28851 E/M 7BS Harmon ***The
Near Sighted Robin* Halberstadt**

Flew position 2-3 in High Squadron.

Carried 12 500 lb general purpose bombs. Dropped the bombs
on the primary target at 1247 hours from 23,800 ft. Bombs on the target area,
spread a little to the right.

No damage to the plane or crew.

At 1139 hours, observed 8 to 10 barrage ballons. At 1141
hours, observed smoke screens at Wesermunde and Itgehoe. At 1153 hours, 5 miles
Northeast of Wesermunde we encountered meager but accurate flak. The bombardier
saw Terrys ship hit by flak with #4 engine catching fire. Terry pulled out of
formation and lost altitude. The fire seemed to go out and he seemed to be
under control. Six chutes were seen coming from this plane. While watching
Terrys plane, the bombardier also observed a P-51 crash at 1200 hours. (Note:
The Near Sighted Robin, plane 851, was flying left wing, position 2-3, in
Terrys element, who was flying position 2-1, or lead of that second element.
Plane 209, a silver ship named The Wrangler, was flying on Terrys
right wing in position 2-2. This mission folder contains a photo of Terrys
plane shortly after being hit, with #4 engine on fire. This same photo also
shows The Near Sighted Robin and The Wrangler in their wing positions on
either side of Terrys plane, but higher, since Terry has lost altitude.)
