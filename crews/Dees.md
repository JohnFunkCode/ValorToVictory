Dees crew

Their original plane may have been named ***Sweetheart of
Harlech***, but not 42-94824, which was Avriett's ***Umbriago***
in the 7th Squadron. Since ***Generator Jennie*** was a replacement aircraft,
this would have been their 2nd B-24, but they didn't fly it often and not until
July so there are questions.
