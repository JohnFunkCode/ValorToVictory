B-24J **44-40303 E/K** ***Turgo Joe*** salvaged
with battle damage. F/O Hayes pilot, was flying 4-2 position in the lead
squadron at 20,000 feet when hit by flak over Le Harve, France. It is reported
that the whole nose blew off and two engines were hit and the whole forward
part of the ship was peppered with flak. Practically all the front portion of
the plane was blown out except the nose turret and the back of the pilots
seat. The pilot was injured in the leg. The top turret gunner, S/Sgt. Arthur J.
Duffelmeier, the Navigator, 2 Lt. Stanley A. Maw, and the Co-pilot, 2 Lt. Lloyd
Anderson either bailed out or were blown from the plane. The Bombardier, 2 Lt.
Henry S. McPherson was killed by flak but his body remained in the plane. The
other three landed in France. All the controls were gone except the aileron.
The engineer locked the rudder. The hydraulic system was out as was the oxygen
system, the autopilot compass, and the autogyro and the plane was also running
out of fuel. The injured pilot decided to crash land on English soil and the
Engineer, T/SGT Alvin Gibbons, assisted in flying the plane back to England.
After the remainder of the crew had bailed out over the English coast, the
Engineer assisted the pilot in jumping, then trimmed the plane for the crash
landing and was then the last to leave the plane. Six crewmen were
hospitalized, which includes everyone that made it back to England. At the time
it was know that McPherson had been killed but the fate of the other three was
still unknown.
