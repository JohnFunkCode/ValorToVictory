Jones WS crew

NOTE: The tail gunner on this crew, Harold Carothers, had a fascinating
military career in WWII, as related in a letter by Dr. Milton Braveman to MM,
Dec 1989, p.26.  Harold "outlined a
fascinating service record from pre-Pearl Harbor days at Clark Field in the
Phillipines, through aerial gunnery school and his 22 missions with the 92nd BG
where he was the only survivor of his crew. This was followed by some 20
additional missions with the 95th and 100th Bomb Groups. With each of these
groups he lost more crew members and suffered severe wounds. He was returned to
the States for R \& R and assigned to PR duty to boost the sale of War
Bonds. He requested and received orders back to the 8th AF where he was
assigned as tail gunner with the Wyatt Jones crew of the 18th Squadron. Only
with the 34th BG did he complete a full combat tour. He was at flight engineer
school when, at Gen Hap Arnold's directive, Harold was transferred to the
Pacific Theater. The second of his two missions in B-29s was the last bombing
of Japan. Incidentally, he was over Berlin the first time that city was
attacked by the 8th AF."
