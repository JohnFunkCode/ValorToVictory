Bower
crew

**According
to crewmember Dwight Bell**, the original B-24 was named ***Small Change***, The second
B-24 was ***Small Change II***. The third plane was a B-17. James
Barnes drew up the logo for Small Change and painted it on the back of the crew's
flight jackets. Bell still had his flight jacket in the late 1980s. Crew
highlights: Dropping radar foil at tree top level to an enlisted men's rest
home at Christmas to use as tinsel for their Christmas Tree; the test flight to
a nearby base for ice cream; the way Bower landed our damaged plane on one
wheel at the home base without anyone suffering more than a few bruises.
