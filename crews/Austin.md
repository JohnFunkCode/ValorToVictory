Mission #115 January 20, 1945 B-17G **43-38263 E/N** This
plane caught fire in #1 engine during assembly over Buncher #19 at about 20,000
feet. As the flames began to flow over the wing, the pilot had the crew stand
by for bail out. As the flames continued to increase in intensity and the
aircraft started to go out of control into in diving spiral, the pilot ordered
the bail out as it seemed the plane could blow up at any moment. 5 crewmembers
bailed out at this time, over the English Channel. Air-Sea Rescue was advised
immediately. When the increased airspeed seemed to extinguish the flames, the
remaining crew was ordered to stand by and await developments. Returning to the
field the plane caught fire once again then went out as it came in for a
landing. Caught fire again when it landed but went out as the prop stopped
turning. As the crew left the plane, it caught fire once again and had to be
put out by the fire crews. With 7BS. Pilot: Austin. Unnumbered Missing Air Crew
Report showing 5 MIA, later changed to KIA. The plane was eventually repaired
and put back into service.
