Damaged in a landing accident, which was charged to CP
Edward J. Lonergan

NOTE: In a letter to MM, March 1989, p. 20, Darrell W.
Bullis gives the following account of the crash landing. "On Feb. 3, 1945,
our target was Berlin. The aircraft name and number has been forgotten. Upon
return, with no battle damage, it was lucky that our crew was all in crash
landing position. Just after touchdown, and while still rolling rapidly down
the runway, the pilot reached down and pulled up on the flight control lock
handle. As long as the wheel stayed back everything was OK, but when the pilot
dumped the wheel forward the lock snapped into place. The tail went up and the
nose started scrapping the runway. Both the pilot and co-pilot stood up on the
brakes to stop the plane. When it stopped the tail came down hard and the
fuselage broke in two just aft of the radio room. No one was hurt. The crew all
got out OK. The meat wagons and crash trucks all came charging up along with a
large crowd. Also a Colonel demanding to know who had wrecked his airplane. He
was looking for someone to eat out. The crew was offering to fight anyone that
said anything to the pilot who was crying like a baby. The Colonel insisted on
knowing who had caused the wreck. The pilot admitted he had done it all by
himself. The Colonel then asked the crew if we wanted to continue to fly with
him. We told him that we would not fly with anyone else. Noting our unity, the Colonel
then ordered the wreckage be taken to the scrap heap and the furnishing of another
aircraft for the crew. Nothing else was said about the wreck."
