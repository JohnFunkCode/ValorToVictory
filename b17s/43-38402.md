NOTE: From the files of Walter Sturdivan, quoted from MM,
September 2004, p. 11\. "On this date (March 26, 1945), B-17 43-38402 was
lost due to weather conditions, which at times was our worst enemy while flying
combat in WWII. Upon returning from an operational mission, our group
encountered inclement weather and the 34th Group leader instructed the squadron
leader to peel off the aircraft on top
of the cloud layer and make an SOP instrument let down on Buncher 19\. At
approximately 1802 hours an explosion was seen from Control Tower at Station
156, followed closely by a second explosion.
Investigation revealed one aircraft to be 43-38402, piloted by Lt. H. H.
McCutchan, and the other aircraft was identified as one from the 452nd Bomb
Group, AAF Station 142, at Deophen Green. The two aircraft collided in mid-air
about 8 miles southwest of our station; All personnel of both aircraft were
killed. Responsibility was blamed 100% on weather."
