44-8605 ***Happy Warrior*** ***/ Homesick Angel***

B-17G-75-VE

October 31, 1944 Delivered to Lincoln

December 15, 1944 to Grenier

December 20, 1944 Assigned to 18th Squadron, 34th
Bomb Group, Mendlesham

Lost March 25, 1945

According to Robert L. Steiner, Navigator on the Abrams
crew, in a letter dated March 30, 2000, states that this plane was named ***Happy
Warrior***. Eddie Croom, one of the gunners, was a pretty accomplished
artist and painted ***Happy Warrior*** flight jackets for the crew.
Steiner eventually donated his flight jacket to the Air Force Museum in Dayton,
OH where

Renamed ***Homesick Angel*** sometime after the
Abrams crew completed their tour.

According to Les Thompson, CP on the Buchanan crew, before
they were assigned to "Tempest Turner" as their regular plane, they
flew a ship named "Homesick Angel." "When we came back from a
three day pass there was a B-17 scattered all over the field. It was the
"Homesick Angel" that had gone in from a near miss with another
plane." (From MM, March 1988, p.5) These details fit this plane, flown by
the Buchanan crew on March 23, 1945\. Their first mission with "Tempest
Turner" was March 28th (after the three day pass) and in the meantime,
"Homesick Angel" had crashed March 25th with the Bennett crew, all
KIA, shortly after take-off for the mission that was recalled almost
immediately due to bad weather.

From the files of Walter Sturdivan, quoted from MM,
September 2004, p. 11\. "Lt. Bennett took off in aircraft B-17G 44-8605 at
0601 hours on an operational mission. At 0615 the aircraft was seen to start
into a spin and pull out. The tail section broke at Station 5 and the plane
spun into the ground and exploded. The pilot is believed to have executed a
violent maneuver to avoid collision with another aircraft, inadvertently
stalling and starting into a spin. Due to the extremely low altitude, a sharp
pullout was attempted causing the aircraft to break in two. The Yellow Squadron
aircraft plummeted to earth between the bomb dump and the dispersed planes on
the airdrome. After striking the ground, all but one of the bombs exploded.
Ordinance personnel later removed said bomb. When the Fire Equipment came on
scene there was little that could be done except cover the burning spot fires
in the area. The fire fighters returned three times during the day to cover an
engine with foam. The entire crew perished."
