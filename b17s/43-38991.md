43-38911 Start Swimming; later Sweet Seventeen






 




43-38911
***Sweet Seventeen*** 

B-17G-100-BO

 (may have earlier been
called Start Swimming, but not the photo on the back cover of Steve Birdsalls
book, B-17 Flying Fortress in Color.)

 

October 30, 1944 Delivered to
Lincoln

November 12, 1944 to Dow
Field

November 19, 1944 Assigned to
7th Squadron, 34th Bomb Group, Mendlesham.

 

Steve Birdsells book, Flying
Colors: B-17 Flying Fortress in Color, shows this serial number with a
photo of Start Swimming. However, closer examination of the photo shows that
the plane called Start Swimmings serial number begins with 44, not 43\.
