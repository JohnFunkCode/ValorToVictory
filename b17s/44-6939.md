44-6939 ***Mizpah***

B-17G-70-DL

December 26, 1944 Delivered to Lincoln

January 10, 1945 to Dow Field

January 21, 1945 Assigned to 7th Squadron, 34th
Bomb Group, Mendlesham

**From Carl B. Stemen, Pilot, 34th BG:**

My crew told me to have my wife "Peg" name the
plane. She chose the name MIZPAH, which means, "May the Lord watch between
me and thee while we are absent one from another." When Chaplain Eller saw
the name he said that this plane would always come back and he would like to
sneak on board and fly with us. He was correct and I always repeated the 23rd
Psalm to myself as we flew to our target. It seemed as if I always came to the
part "yea though I walk through the valley of death," when we would
be at our IP. The Lord was with us for in all the missions we flew, I was the
only one hit, but we all came back safely.
