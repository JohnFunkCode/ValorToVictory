Mission #79 October 17, 1944 B-17G **43-38353 E/A *Lili
Marlene***With 7BS Missing in Action Cologne flak. At 0915 hours
there was a small fire in #1 engine. Some crews reported seeing trailing vapor
which would indicate the wing tanks were on fire. After 3-5 minutes the plane
peeled out of formation and into a shallow dive in an apparent attempt to put
out the fire. Following this maneuver black smoke issued from the engine (#1).
When last seen, it was trailing smoke, but seemed under control and holding altitude
at 17,000 feet. At 1012 hours, near Liege, a B-17 was observed flying at 12,000
feet with #1 engine on fire and escorted by 5 P-51 fighters. This could
possibly be the same aircraft. Crashed Ahrweiler, Germany. Pilot: Capt.
McAllister. Missing Air Crew Report \# 9468\. 1 Killed in Action, 9 Prisoner of
War including George H. Carroll, wounded in parachute. See 34th
Bombardment Group (H) 1941-1945 pp. 43-44 were George Ritchie tells in a
story titled The Not So Great Escape about his experience as a Prisoner of
War following this mission and his eventual escape.
