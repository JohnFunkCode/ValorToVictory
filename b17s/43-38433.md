Sir, I'll see you tomorrow.

Let me know if I got
anything wrong.

DM honors WWII
Airman with Purple Heart on 60 year anniversary.

By Senior Airman
Cat Casaigne

It's been said the generation
of men and women who served in the great world wars was the "greatest
generation," and the Desert Lightning Team had the chance to honor a
member of that great generation by presenting a long over-due Purple Heart Oct.
15\.

Oct. 15, 1944, 60
years prior to the day he received the award, Tech. Sgt. Thomas Chrisman was
flying over Nazi Germany as a radio operator on a B-17 when he and his crew
came under extreme anti-aircraft fire. A shell exploded right under the plane.
The explosion injured Mr. Chrisman, who was hit with shrapnel in his right hand
and arm. It also took out two engines and damaged a third. The bomber dropped
out of formation and when the pilot gained control, they headed slowly home.
Despite his injuries, Mr. Chrisman stayed on the radio, ensuring that if the
crew and the bomber did not reach their base, there would be a rescue crew to
pick them up. The plane did make it home to England where it successfully crash
landed.

Col. Mike Spencer,
355th Wing commander, presented a Purple Heart to Mr. Chrisman, who had tears
of joy streaming down his face, at a commander's call. Mr. Chrisman's family,
to include his wife, children, grandchildren, and a great grandchild, were
there to support him.

"I, like so
many young men, went to war when the country needed me," Mr. Chrisman
said. "I never asked my country for anything except for a place to live my
life the way I wanted to live it. Thank God for the United States of
America."

Mr. Chrisman said
the crew he flew with had a goal: To go home to the United States together.
After getting hit, Mr. Chrisman did not want to miss a mission, which would
have made the goal impossible, so although he did seek medical attention, he
played the injury off like a scratch, allowing his hand to heal with the shrapnel
inside. The piece of shrapnel was removed from his hand two years ago.

"Today is the
60th anniversary of the day I was awarded this for," he said. "Back
then, there was not the media like there is today and there was a fire in the
hall of records in 1973 when all of my medical records were destroyed, so this
has been a long time coming. Everyone else says it's about time, but I did not
really know what to expect. It had happened during the war and I had just about
given up on it. But my lovely wife persisted and we saw the results
today."

Colonel Spencer
said it was truly his honor to present the award to Mr. Chrisman.

"Mr. Chrisman
is an Airman in every sense of the word," Colonel Spencer said at the
commander's call. "He served his country in war and peace, and we have the
chance to honor him for one of his truly heroic days. I am very proud to have
this opportunity. We in the Desert Lightning Team are very fortunate for
your service, your sacrifice and the legacy you've set for us."

Oct. 15, 1944 was
not the only time Mr. Chrisman's crew ran into trouble. On two other occasions,
the crew was forced to crash land. One time, they crash landed while carrying
300 five gallon cans of fuel to Gen. Patton's Army. Mr. Chrisman spent 2
years in the military where he completed 34 combat missions. He turned 20 years
old one month after he entered the Army Air Corps.

"I had always
had a love for airplanes and radio was a hobby of mine," he said.
"The only advice I could give today's Airmen is learn all you can about
your job and do it the best you can do, because the training you are going to
get will save you live."

Mr. Chrisman said
it was an honor to serve his country.

"I am very
proud to receive the medal, and if I was able and my country needed me, yes, I
would do it all over again," he said.

Very respectfully,

SrA Cat. Casaigne
