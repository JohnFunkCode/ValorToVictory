41-28865 ***Loni (League of Nations, Inc.)***

B-24H-15-DT

**A 34th BG Original.**

This plane was CAM and had grayed out stars.

Might have been originally named ***The Wrangler.***
The available photo of this plane does not show a name on the co-pilot
side. The McDermott crew's second
regular plane was ***The Wrangler***, 42-51209, for which there is
ample photographic evidence. As their first plane, 41-28865 might also have
originally carried that name.

See photo in HeltonÂ’s Hellcats, p.48.
