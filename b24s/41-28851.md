plane, the bombardier also observed a P-51 crash at 1200 hours. (Note: The
Near Sighted Robin, plane 851, was flying left wing, position 2-3, in Terrys
element, who was flying position 2-1, or lead of that second element. Plane
209, a silver ship named The Wrangler, was flying on Terrys right wing
in position 2-2. This mission folder contains a photo of Terrys plane shortly
after being hit, with #4 engine on fire. This same photo also shows The Near
Sighted Robin and The Wrangler in their wing positions on either side of
Terrys plane, but higher, since Terry has lost altitude.)

Mission #54 August 7, 1944 41-28851 E/M Winsor ***The
Near Sighted Robin*** **Remilly**

Flew as an airborne spare but apparently did fly the mission,
filling in position 2-2 in the Low Squadron.

Carried 20 500 lb bombs. All bombs were brought back due to
8/10 cloud coverage of the target area.

The plane did receive slight flak damage.

At 1030 hours, encounter flak from Liege in 3 gun bursts. 3
ships were hit. One feathered #4 engine (not on fire), and dropped his bombs at
1038 hours. Another B-24 with #2 engine feathered and on fire, pulled out of
formation, lost altitude and headed out on course 360 degrees. The lead ship
was seen to pull out of formation in a steep glide (no fires seen), pulled out
and that was the last we saw of this ship. (Note: The lead ship, 44-40323,
piloted by Erwin was MIA on this mission. The other damaged ships made it back
to base.)

The following account of The
Near Sighted Robin in Sweden was supplied by Ingemar Melin.

1 LT BARRICK was leading a small group that repaired a
number of B-24s and B-17s that had force landed at Sövde airfield during the
summer of '44. He was one of the Assistant Engineering Officers of the interned
Americans that belonged to the repairing and maintenance group based at
Bulltofta during 1944-45. The group consisted of USAAF-pilots, -navigators,
-engineers, -radio operators and -gunners, all crewmen from force landed Amarican
bombers that came to Sweden.

One of the planes was "The Near Sighted Robin."
See below part of a technical report written by Lt. Barrick in November 1944
that contains details from the repairing of The Near Sighted Robin.

*"...the worst headache of the whole job was B-24
"Near Sighted Robin". This airplane had major damages from flak, and
a right waist window had been thrown out, smashing the leading edge of the
horizontal stabilizer. We estimated a long job, after surveying the battle
damage, but we had a bit of bad luck when we tried to taxi it out of a mud hole
to a ramp. The nose wheel had been previously damaged due to the Swedes moving
the aircraft without a guide bar for the nose wheel, resulting in the nose
wheel collapsing and causing major damage to the nose structural members. The
aircraft was jacked up, a new nose wheel assembly installed and moved to the
ramp.**The sheet metal crew removed all damaged parts, replacing plexi-glass
with sheet metal and structural members salvaged from wrecked aircraft at
Malmo. Another B-24 with approximately the same damage at Malmo, took one month
for eight of ABA's highly trained men to complete. Whereas four men, Brandt,
Gooding, McDaniels and Thompson under the direction of Lt. Grosscup completed
their job in two weeks time.*

*On this same aircraft, No.4 engine was changed,
including the electrical wiring and junction box. Both vertical stabilizers
were removed and repaired. The horizontal stabilizer was replaced. The wiring
to the No.1 and No.2 superchargers were shot through in two places resulting in
many difficulties for all of us, especially T/Sgt. Marcotte our
electrician..."*

*"..on the 13th of October when the group were
finished with their work on the planes they all, except for four men, left for
Malmö. Due to supercharger problems on "Near Sighted Robin" we four
stayed until the 16th October when the job was finished..."*

1 January 1945

A report, from the U.S. Embassy in Sweden listing the planes
presently interned in Sweden, shows B-24H 41-28851 in flyable condition at
Vasteras. Previous location shown as Sovdeborg.

1 April 1945

A report from the U.S. Embassy in Sweden listing the planes
presently interned in Sweden shows B-24H 41-28851 in fair condition, location
not specified.

After the European war ended in May 1945, 41-28851 was
returned to the United Kingdom and later flown back to the United States.

23 August 1945

B-24H 41-28851 arrives at Stillwater, OK for postwar
salvage, just one day short of a year after flying its last combat mission and
being interned in Sweden.
