42-94745 ***The Bold Sea Rover***

B-24H-15-FO

**A 34th BG Original**

This plane may have originally been Pedigo's and named ***Cokey
Flo***. The story has it that after Pedigo damaged the original ***Tommy
Thumper*** in a landing accident (May 12, 1944\) his plane was taken away
from him and he flew various planes until eventually getting a B-24J, 44-40486,
which was then also named ***Cokey Flo***.

This plane would then have been renamed after the transfer
to the 486th BG.
