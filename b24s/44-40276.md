Flew Lead of Group A (7th).

Carried 52 100 lb bombs. Dropped on Primary at 2055 hours
from 23,000 feet.

Reported Major battle damage.

From Tavastis after mission report: The lead ship
(McAlister) was hit by flak in the Bombay just as bombs were away. Due to the
great amount of gasoline spraying in the Bombay, all electrical units, radios,
generators, inverters and heated suits were turned off. As a result, no strike
report was relayed by lead ship of lead group. An accurate survey of damage was
extremely difficult so lead ship left formation while returning to England.
After all gasoline had drained from the #3 fuel cells, #3 engine was lost as
cross-feed hose was damaged. #3 was feathered for the return flight to base,
but unfeathered shortly before landing to provide hydraulic pressure for gear,
flaps and brakes, as it seemed unadvisable to operate the auxiliary hydraulic
pump with great amounts of liquid gasoline and fumes present in bombay. 

Landed at 2234 hours.

No Crew Loading List available.
