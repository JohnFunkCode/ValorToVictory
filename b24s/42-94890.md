42-94890 Donald Duck






 




42-94890 ***Chesty***

B-24H-20-FO

**A 34th BG Original**

Crew Chief: M/Sgt Willard Fager, 391st Squadron

This plane has been determined to be Chesty after a long and
sometimes confusing process of research, which also determined that 44-40284
was Tondelayo. Both of these planes were in the charge of Willard Fager as Crew
Chief, both were coded L/J and both were flown by the Foster crew. After Chesty
and before Tondelayo, the Foster crew flew the original Maid of Fury, after it
had been changed to L/J.

This plane may have been renamed Donald Duck prior to being
salvaged.
