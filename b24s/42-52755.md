42-52755 Percolatin Pete






 




42-52755 ***Dynamite N Dodo*** (#2)

B-24H-15-FO

NOTE: This is the only 8th Air Force heavy bomber
known to have shot down a V-1 buzz bomb. According to Hudson (R) on the Noble
Wright crew, it was George Baldwin (TT) on this crew who shot down the V-1
"buzz bomb" while returning from a mission to France flying in
42-52755, Dynamite 'N Dodo. The exact date of this incident has yet to be
determined. (See Memdlesham Memories, Dec 1986, page 2.)

This plane was named Dynamite N Dodo by the Wright crew to
replace the original Dynamite N Dodo, 41-29522, that they flew over to England
but which had been almost immediately transferred to another group, even before
the Wright crew ever flew a mission in it. Its name is noted in several sources
as Percolatin Pete. Perhaps this was its name with a subsequent group.
