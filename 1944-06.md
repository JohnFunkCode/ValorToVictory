**Mission
#10
Caen**

Command
Pilot: GERHART. 24 planes were dispatched with 72 tons of bombs to Caen France
in support of the D-Day landings. Two aircraft aborted. Due to 10/10 clouds and
D-Day channel traffic, the group was forced to return with all bombs still
aboard. One plane crashed along the coast when it ran out of fuel with 8
crewmen KIA and 1 Missing in Action. The 34th had been one of the first groups
airborne. Roger Freeman Mighty Eighth War Diary on page 259 states that
going out one 34BG plane crashed at Corfe Castle with 10 killed. (It was early
morning, before 10 AM, but they were returning.)

Tours**

This
was the "Intruder" mission. 

Command
Pilot: GARRETT. 26 planes were dispatched to Tours, France with 78 tons of

B-24J **44-40303 E/K** ***Turgo Joe***
salvaged with battle damage. F/O Hayes pilot, was flying 4-2 position in the
lead squadron at 20,000 feet when hit by flak over Le Harve, France. It is
reported that the whole nose blew off and two engines were hit and the whole
forward part of the ship was peppered with flak. Practically all the front
portion of the plane was blown out except the nose turret and the back of the
pilots seat. The pilot was injured in the leg. The top turret gunner, S/Sgt.
Arthur J. Duffelmeier, the Navigator, 2 Lt. Stanley A. Maw, and the Co-pilot, 2
Lt. Lloyd Anderson either bailed out or were blown from the plane. The
Bombardier, 2 Lt. Henry S. McPherson was killed by flak but his body remained
in the plane. The other three landed in France. All the controls were gone
except the aileron. The engineer locked the rudder. The hydraulic system was
out as was the oxygen system, the autopilot compass, and the autogyro and the
plane was also running out of fuel. The injured pilot decided to crash land on
English soil and the Engineer, T/SGT Alvin Gibbons, assisted in flying the
plane back to England. After the remainder of the crew had bailed out over the
English coast, the Engineer assisted the pilot in jumping, then trimmed the
plane for the crash landing and was then the last to leave the plane. Six
crewmen were hospitalized, which includes everyone that made it back to
England. At the time it was know that McPherson had been killed but the fate of
the other three was still unknown.

### Mission #23 Beaumetz les Aires

 

Command Pilot: TAVASTI. 26 planes dispatched. 12
aircraft bombed this airfield, dropping 30.25 tons, while 14 failed to bomb.
One plane did not return, crashing into the English Channel. There is no
Missing Air Crew Report for this mission and no deaths reported on this date,
so the crew apparently was recovered from the English Channel and returned to
duty. I have not found a B-24 serial number listed as either lost r salvaged on
this date. Score: poor to fair.
