B-17G
**43-38263 E/N** This plane caught fire in #1 engine during assembly over
Buncher #19 at about 20,000 feet. As the flames began to flow over the wing,
the pilot had the crew stand by for bail out. As the flames continued to
increase in intensity and the aircraft started to go out of control into in
diving spiral, the pilot ordered the bail out as it seemed the plane could blow
up at any moment. 5 crewmembers bailed out at this time, over the English
Channel. Air-Sea Rescue was advised immediately. When the increased airspeed
seemed to extinguish the flames, the remaining crew was ordered to stand by and
await developments. Returning to the field the plane caught fire once again
then went out as it came in for a landing. Caught fire again when it landed but
went out as the prop stopped turning. As the crew left the plane, it caught
fire once again and had to be put out by the fire crews. With 7BS. Pilot:
Austin. Unnumbered Missing Air Crew Report showing 5 MIA, later changed to KIA.
The plane was eventually repaired and put back into service.
