DEDICATION  

This site is dedicated to the men who served this country in the 34th Bomb Group and its support units. Here you will find the histories of the planes and crews that made up the 34th Bomb Group. We also remember and honor the ground crews that kept the B-24s and later B-17s flying on mission after mission.
  
  

This site is especially dedicated to my uncle, Dexter Burwell Jordan, 7th Squadron Crew Chief. His charges included the B-24, "The Near Sighted Robin" and the B-17, "Sweet Seventeen." T/Sgt Jordan received the Bronze Star for sending his planes out on over 100 missions without an abort atributed to mechanical failure. He also received the Soldier's Medal for putting out a fire on a B-17 on its hardstand. Had the plane exploded it could easily have killed upward of 20 ground crew members who were totally unaware of the dangerous situation that had developed close by their position.
  
  

I am always looking for additional photos of 34th BG planes, crews and station life. If you or your loved one served in the 34th BG and you have a story to share or a photo scrapbook that might add to the site, please feel free to contact me. You may reach me at the following email address. "ferrellumm@netscape.net"

34th BOMB GROUP ASSOCIATION MEMBERSHIP NOTICE  

At the 2004 Reunion a new Treasurer was elected, Bonnie Zylsta.

SEND DUES to Hal Province, 31 Shore Crest Cir, Carriere, MS 39426\. Hal's phone number remains the same.

CALLING ALL GROUND CREW MEMBERS! YOUR HELP IS NEEDED NOW!  

[NEW PAGE ADDED ON CREW CHIEFS AND GROUND CREW MEMBERS](CrewChiefs.md)
  

On this new page, dedicated to the Ground Crews that kept the bombers flying, I am listing all of the known Crew Chiefs, by Squadron, along with any available information on the men that worked with the Crew Chiefs and the planes they maintained. Except for the MOS number 750 on the passenger lists of the men being deployed to England and those flying home after the war, none of this information appears in the official records of the group. I will need your help to make this page anywhere close to complete. If you worked on a ground crew, please let me know the name of the Crew Chief and possibly the names or numbers of the planes you helped maintain. The ground crews always seem to get scant mention in the unit histories. Let's do together what we can to correct that situation where the 34th Bomb Group is concerned.  

Send replies to me, Gary Ferrell at ferrellumm@netscape.net.  
  

MORE HELP WANTED!!!  

I would like to add information and photos about the other aircraft at Mendlesham besides the B-24s and B-17s. I know there was an early P-51 and later a P-47. There was also a Piper L-4, a C-78 Bobcat, an A-20, a C-64 Nouseman and possibly other aircraft. Please contact me with any information and/or photos of these planes.  

I would also like to have information on the ground equipment used by the 34th BG, like the Cletrac shown above. Again, please contact me with information and/or photos of 34th BG jeeps, trucks, firetrucks, ambulances, etc. THANKS.  

Send replies to me, Gary Ferrell at ferrellumm@netscape.net.
