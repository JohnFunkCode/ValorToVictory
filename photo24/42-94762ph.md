42-94762 The Uninvited  
  

![](42-94762.jpg)  

This photo shows the Coupland crew, but they never flew a combat mission in this plane. By the time this photo was taken (about August 1st, judging by the mission markers) Coupland's regular plane, Frivolous Sal, had already been lost with another crew.
