This is the original 34th BG, Tommy Thumper, which was damaged May 12, 1944 in a landing accident while being flown by the Pedigo crew on a training flight. This plane never flew combat. This plane was flown to England by the Thrun crew and his crew was given another plane, which they named Tommy Thumper II.
