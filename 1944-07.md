B-24H
**42-94930 E/O** ***Kisco Kid*** was hit by flak on the bomb run
causing considerable damage to the fuselage and wings. Right after bombs away,
another flak burst cut the rudder control cables and damaged #1 engine. The
pilot headed directly for England but kept bearing left due to #1 engine being
out. As the ship came over the Southern tip of England, still bearing left
toward the open sea, the crew was ordered to bail out, the pilot and navigator
being the last ones out. The plane exploded just before hitting the ground at
West Malling. With 7BS. Pilot: Holmes. Unnumbered Missing Air Crew Report. All
but two crewmembers were wounded or injured and four were seriously wounded but
the four are not identified.
